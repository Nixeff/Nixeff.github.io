            <p>I felt its presence. I always did. but i never understood. 
                I thought of myself as crazy, delusional, delirious. But no they exist and they are angry. 
                This worlds life span can be shortenedâ€¦ No it will be. 
                They created it after all. But we didn't listen. We did as we pleased and ignored their calls. 
                One lays dead now and the rest are furious. 
                In the back of my mind i feel them eating away removing something. 
                I don't know what. Their anger turns to laughter. I grab a knife and walk out the door. </p>
            <p>
                There on the streat I see a little girl in a red dress. She couldn't be older then 7 winters. 
                The blood splatters across her face and dress as she bites down into the neck of the amber haired woman. 
                I think they are family. She is too busy with finishing her mother off to notice me walking up and before she can react the knife decapitates her. 
                The woman's expression is that of love and contempt. Her last vision was that of her child. Or was it of them? 
                I look around and hear acts of violence all around. People being murdered left and right, the streets filling up with blood and gore. 
                A sense of unease washes over me as i take it in. Something is off... But i just can't tell what. 
                While I wonder I feel a cold sensation in my lower abdomen. Looking down i see the steel blade that pierced me. 
                The scarlet liquid coating the otherwise beautiful blade obscuring the reflection of my sickly smile. 
                Why was i smiling? I'm dying... I feel something hit my entire body at once. 
                I feel a rocky hard surface covering one half of my body. I'm on the ground? As i look up i see my killer. 
                They are wearing a dark knight armour. But they are strange. Water is coming out of their eyes like they had done something wrong. 
                People are charging the knight and the last thing I see before the great dark abyss takes my soul is the knight grabbing a symbol of a branch impaling a goat muttering a prayer and ready themself for battle.</p>
