            <p>The small fishing boat was peacefully floating on the open sea. The fisherman had gotten a great big catch today. Way more then he needed for his small village. He was dividing up the fish in different piles. Those that would be sold and eaten this week and those in need of salting for longer storage. With all of these fish he would be able to stay on land for the next couple weeks and be able to work on his home. Make it nice and safe for his wife and unborn child. </p>
            <p><i>*crash!*</i> A wave hit the hull splashing water onto deck. <i>"Strange"</i> the fisherman proclaims. The sea was as still as a panther silently watching its pray waiting for the right moment. As the fisherman watches starboard another wave hits from the port. Before he can react another wave comes from the stern. Each more violent then the last. But when the fisherman looks out in the horizon the sea  is as still as it can be. </p>
            <p><i>*Crack!*</i> The fisherman quickly turns his head to see the source of the crack and that's when he sees a gigant strange harpoon. It couldn't be one of his, Its nearly the size of the entire boat. It is made of a dark steel, its blade is only sharp on one side and its hooks seems to be in the shape of a squids tentacles. The rest of the metal shaft is covered in metallic tentacles and seaweed from what could only be the sea bed. Its head launched into the deck cracking it. Panicking not wanting to have the boat sink. The man tries to lift the gigantic harpoon out of the deck not even thinking about where it possibly could have come from. Not even noticing the rope that was attached to the end of it leading down into the abyss. While trying to lift the great armament to no avail. He notices the boat is going backwards. And a loud feminin voice booms out of the sea. 
                <i>"Your massacre of the kind inhabitants of the coral reef know by its inhabitants as The shell reef.  Shall not go unpunished. You land born always take more then needed not thinking of anyone else but youre selves. But don't you worry. I will toss you in to Davy Jones locker myself"</i></p>
            <p>He turns around to be greeted by the head of a woman's head bigger then any whale he had ever seen. Her skin have patches of coral and barnacles spread out on her forehead. only her glowing blue eyes and dark seaweed entangled hair is visible. She is staring right at him. The rope from the harpoon leads down to right under her head. The fisherman was frozen with fear. As the god of the sea while still starring right into the fisherman's soul begins to open her mouth. Slowly the boat gets dragged towards her maw which begins to unhinge getting bigger ang bigger. Before the boat gets fully engulfed the goddess pulls out her harpoon and then closes her mouth with the whole boat inside.</p>
            <p>Its dark. The fisherman scrambles around on trying to find his lantern and when he dose and manages to light it. He regrets ever doing so. the fisherman is not alone on his boat anymore. Humanoid creatures with coral for heads and skeleton bodies have souronded the ship some have already started climbing on it. The fisherman tries fighting them off. A kick in the chest connects on one of them and actually making all its body parts scatter on the floor. But there are too many of them. They grab the fisher man pulling him off his ship dragging him towards the goddess throat. He fights and fights knocking some down but there are always more too replace them. The fisherman starts to pray but even then the creatures shove pieces of seaweed in his mouth to stop him. There is no saviour here. As he accepts his fate he gets thrown into the darkness never to be seen again.</p>
            <p>The fisherman's wife never took another love. Spending her days watching the sea hoping that one day her husband would return too her and their new-born child.</p>
